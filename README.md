Leave Tracker App
A Salesforce Lightning Web Components application for managing employee leave requests with manager approval workflow.

This application provides a complete leave management system built on the Salesforce platform using Lightning Web Components, Apex classes, and custom objects. It allows employees to submit leave requests and managers to approve or reject them with real-time status updates.

The project includes a custom LeaveRequest object with fields for From Date, To Date, Reason, Status, User, and Manager Comment. The frontend is built using Lightning Web Components with a clean, responsive interface that works across desktop and mobile devices. The backend uses Apex controllers to handle data operations and business logic with role-based access control.

Employees can submit new leave requests, view their personal request history, edit pending requests, and track the status of their submissions. Managers have access to view all team leave requests, approve or reject them with one-click actions, add comments to requests, and manage the entire approval workflow through a comprehensive dashboard.

The application was developed in 10 phases covering project setup, object creation, Apex development, Lightning Web Components creation, Lightning App setup, user acceptance testing, manager approval workflow, controller enhancements, performance optimization, and comprehensive testing verification.
